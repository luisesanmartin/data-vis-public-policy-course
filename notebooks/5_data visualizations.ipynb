    "All my data preparation was conducted on the notebooks from [this folder](https://github.com/luisesanmartin/data-vis-public-policy-course/tree/master/notebooks).

    "* **GIS data of the districts of Peru:** Generated and published by INEI, the National Institute of Statistics of Peru. It was published along with the results of the Poverty Map 2013.

    "* **Data from the National Households Survey (ENAHO):** Also collected by INEI. Specifically, I used the 2018 datasets of the health, labor, dwelling and summary modules; along with the 2014-2017 datasets of the dwelling and summary modules. This data can be downloaded from the [INEI microdata repository](http://iinei.inei.gob.pe/microdatos/).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **District population data from the 2017 National Census:** Unexplicably, INEI has not yet published the microdata of the last National Census conducted in Peru. Instead, only some ad-hoc data queries are available in this [old-fashioned site](http://censos2017.inei.gob.pe/redatam/). From it, I generated queries to download the districts population for Lima and Callao, the two departments in the Lima Metropolitana area.\n",

    "* **Average results by school of 2016 National Students Evaluation:** This data is generated by the Ministry of Education of Peru, and it is available only through formal requests of access to information conducted in-person.

The raw file I received for my request is available in my [raw data folder](https://github.com/luisesanmartin/data-vis-public-policy-course/tree/master/data/raw) (and publishing it does not violate any law of the Peruvian public data protection regulation).\n",

To show this, I will use the results of the last National Evaluation of Students as a proxy for school quality. Though I initially considered a Ridgeplot for this, I finally decided for a Stripplot to show the distribution by zone of the average result by school of the National Students Evaluation for the second year of primary, for all public schools in Lima. The National Students Evaluation was a standardized test conducted by the Ministry of Education of Peru to track the progress of the students' learnings year by year. It was discontinued after 2016 and replaced by a sampled evaluation instead of a nationwide one.\n",
